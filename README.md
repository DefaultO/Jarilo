# Jarilo
###### Jarylo (Cyrillic: Ярило or Ярила; Polish: Jaryło; Serbo-Croatian: Jarilo, Јарило; Belarusian: Ярыла), alternatively Yaryla, Iarilo, or Gerovit, is a Slavic god of vegetation, fertility, and springtime.

This is a bone Repository. I might not release the source of it at all, but rather sell it to some random guy in case Growtopia becomes unplayable and I get tired of it.

Jarila is an external human-like autofarmer for the Game Growtopia. It's the better version of Kekma you could say. Copying technology used in Runescape & Spotify (Click) Bots, this pretty much is fully undetected (and will stay undetected for the rest of its existence). The Jarila Botnet gives you the option to rage and farm non-stop (given you got enough farms) or simulates the life of a real person with sleep time schedules, pauses, "other games you are interested in right now" / not playing gt on some days at all, joining non-farm worlds, replying to player messages, and, and, and. You can configure every single Account, Account Group or Accounts Selection as you like.

Not like other Bots for this Game. This Botnet doesn't simulate packets on its own but uses the official game client to do so. Yes, we are talking about having multiple game instances opened at once. Which might sound like a stupid idea. But because there is something called "no graphics context", which I probably invented for/have brought to this game, the resource usage is pretty low. Which puts it into the same level as console-only bots. This makes it safe and not send packets that don't exist/they suddenly check for.

You will easily earn 20+ DLs per month without even moving a finger. The number depends on how many farms you have and bots your run at the same time. I earn a lot because I am the owner of an absurd amount of worlds. I might as well be the growtopian with the most farm worlds right now. The most worlds someone sold me at once were 80-90 full chands. But there surely is some Korean Kid who no-lifed this game and owns way more than 10.000 worlds. No chance for me. I already need like half a minute to scroll through my whole world list, doing it fast.
