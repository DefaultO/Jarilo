# Jarilo
###### Jarylo (Cyrillic: Ярило or Ярила; Polish: Jaryło; Serbo-Croatian: Jarilo, Јарило; Belarusian: Ярыла), alternatively Yaryla, Iarilo, or Gerovit, is a Slavic god of vegetation, fertility and springtime.

This is a bone Repository. I might not release the source of it at all, but rather sell it to some random guy in case Growtopia becomes unplayable and I get tired of it.

Jarila is an external human-like autofarmer for the Game Growtopia. It's the better version of Kekma you could say. Copying technology used in Runescape & Spotify (Click) Bots, this pretty much is fully undetected (and will stay undetedected for the rest of it's existence). The Jarila Botnet gives you the option to rage and farm non-stop (given you got enough farms) or simulate the life of a real person with sleep time shedules, pauses, "other games you are interested in right now" / not playing gt on some days at all, joining non-farm worlds, replying to player messages, and, and, and. You can configure every single Account, Account Group or Accounts Selection as you like.

Not like other Bots for this Game. This Botnet doesn't simulate packets on it's own but uses the official game client to do so. Yes, we are talking about having multiple game instances opened at once. Which might sound like a stupid idea. But because there is something called like "no graphics context", which I probably invented for/have brought to this game, the ressource usage is pretty low. Which puts it into the same level as console-only bots. This makes it safe and not send packets that don't exist/they suddenly check for.

You will easily earn 20+ DL's per month without even moving a finger. The number really depends on how much farms you have and bots your run at the same time. I earn a lot because I am the owner of an asbud ammount of worlds. I might as well be the growtopian with the most farm worlds right now. The most worlds someone sold me at once were 80-90 full chands. But there surely is some Korean Kid who no-lifed this game and owns way more than 10.000 worlds. No chance for me. I already need like half a minute to scroll through my whole world list, doing it fast.


#### **You want to earn some money? Here's my buying list. Add me on Discord, 0xD3F#1338.**
- **min. 10,00€** : Inventory Data Pointer. Fuck Minxy/Lace#0001. Stealing Ideas from Kekma but doesn't even want to sell me something he doesn't use for overpay. This 14 year old probably doesn't even have it. I'll add more if you teach me how to find it.
- **1,00€ each** : Full Chandelier Farm(s). If you got some leftover farms you don't need, you could sell them for wls and sell those wls for more than 1,00€ or reach out to me if you are not interested of all of that hustle.
- **up to 500,00€** : Some well deved internal/proxy/clientless bot source that can do a basic magplant refill automatically without any human interaction. Possible even harvesting Worlds for that on it's own based off of a list you can edit. This should also include steps for updating the used signatures, offsets, pointers or whatever you use.

The Inventory Data Pointer is more important right now. A few more months and I could probably get that many farms from the profit of every single farm only. The source really is just optional, I am fine right now. But it would be a reason for me to port stuff between languages.
